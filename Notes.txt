Things to add:

Make Frost Armor and Swamp Armor better or worse then put in appropriate loot set.

Thrak's Party Starter: BrokenBottle -> maybe some kind of random potion effect
Maxwell's Silver Hammer: JohnysMallet -> Good against hoardmen, stun?
Healing Ham: BlackforestHam -> Deals hit damage, heals exhaustion.

Frost Armor: FrostArmor -> Move/exhaust slower in blackforest, exhaust faster in swamp, slower in hell,




Necro.Inventory GetItemSlot(ItemDef item)

Necro.Inventory CanCraft(ItemDef itemDef)

This might be an issue for making Weapons function as crafting components.
It checks if an item kind is "Ingredient" or "Currency" to decide if
something is stackable. Could cause you to do something like having weapons stack.
 	bool ItemDef.IsStackable

This might be part of the above issue because it specifies that equipment is not
the same as an ingredient.
	bool ItemDef.IsEquipment

This method seems to be responsible for the placement of 
	void Inventory.SetEquipmentOnBody(Equippable equippable)

This is probably going to be involved in removing things from persistent data
	class HBS.Util.SerializationStream
